# AWS Cloud Formation
End state of the Infrastructure. Supported formats are Json or YAML.
#### Stacks
Cloud formation Template consists of set of AWS Resources (EC2, S3, ELB, VPC, DynamoDB etc..), once created it is known as a Stack (set of related resources as a single unit). For updating the resources within a template, you need to update a stack.

## Beginners [1-5]
## I. Exercise Section 
### 1. Demonstrate sample Cloud Formation Template
		a. Creating EC2 Instance using CF Template
		b. Updating existing stack using CF Template
### 2. Intrinsic Funtions
       Syntax: !Join [*delimiter*,[*string1*,*string2*,*string3*,*...*]]	
### 3. Multiple Resources
	   For Example, During EC2 Launch Instance, there are 2 main aws resources need to be created. However, without these 2 main resources EC2 instance creation will not be successful or you cannot proceed further for EC2 instance creation. The 2 main resources are VPC and Security Groups.
	   a. Using !Ref Function, Lets see how we can use Cloud Formation Template to demonstrate this usage. 
	   b. Pseudo Parameters, Predefined Parameters available for Cloud Formation Template. Similar to Environmental Variables - You can find this demonstration in the location  templates/pseudo-multi.yaml
	   c. Mappings, - templates/mappings.yaml
	   d. Input Parameters,  templates/inputparameters.yaml
       e. Outputs, Provides access to information about resources within a stack - For example - Instance IP Address, DNS Name etc. 
            templates/outputs.yaml
### 4. Sample Web Application
        In this exercise, we will also demonstrate UserData and Helper Scripts.
		a. UserData - It will help to initialize starter scripts / application dependencies before EC2 instance is provisioned
		b. Helper Scripts
			***cfn-init*** - Read and Interprets MetaData to execute AWS::CloudFormation::Init
						cfn-init is used in MetaData section to define single or multiple configuration keys. 
						For Single config key, we need to use ***config:**** 
						For Multiple config keys, we need to use configSets. Configsets contain a list of config keys which is executed in the order we define.
			***cfn-signal*** - Helps to signal when resource or application is ready
			***cfn-get-metadata*** - Retrieve metadata based on a specific key
			***cfn-hup*** - This is used to check for updates to metadata and execute custom hooks
			
			Demo application available in the location - templates/sample-webapplication.yaml
### 5. Changesets Usage
       Process of recreating the resources with existing templates. For example, you can change Instance Name in the EC2 instance without underlying resources defined the cloud formation template.
       Following are the operations supported by ChangeSets:
       a. Create
       b. View
       c. Execute
       d. Delete
       Resource Changes may include - Logical Resource Id / Physical Resource Id, type of cloud formation resource(AWS::EC2::Instance), replacement of existing resources (creating new one and deleting old resource), and scope of the resource which has triggered the update. 
	   Based on the nature of the change, Action will be determined as ADD | MODIFY | REMOVE
	   
	   Following Scenarios will be demonstrated:
	   1. Updating SG group i.e,. removing 22 port from SG - Resulting in updating the SG. Group Description content had port 22 description. In the next step, we will update SG description with Port 80 description because we have removed port 22 from SG inbound rules.
	   2. Updating SG Group Description, which will lead to creation of new SG and deleting old SG. This behavior is because we haven't defined any VPC/Subnet. 
	   3. However, in step. 2, after defining vpc/subnet will also lead to creation of new SG and deleting old SG. This is expected. Once VPC / Subnet is defined, subsequent changes will not cause the creation of new SG and deleting old SG (Replacement).
	   4. Updating SG Description, which will update existing SG descriptions. As we have already defined VPC in step 3 which is expected behavior.
## Proficient
## II. Advance Exercise Section			
### 6. Creating Multiple resources - EC2 Instance, RDS DB Instance(MySQL), and S3 Bucket
       Dynamically create EC2 Instance and DB Instance based on the region selected i.e., there is a usage Mapping Section in the template in which regions (only Asian region are configured for this template), ami's and instance types are defined.
	   This will demonstrate the usage of template portability and reusability. 
	   Template location - advance-templates/wp-infrastructure.yaml
	   
### 7. Installing and Configuring -  Web Server, PHP, WordPress using UserData Section 
       You may review User Data section to customize the steps or to correctly point out the php / webserver versions].
	   Verifying installations, once Cloud Formation Stack is created. [Make sure SSH port 22 and http 80 is opened in security group once EC2 is provisioned]
	   SSH to EC2 Instance, Follow below steps -
	  $ cd /var/www/html
	  
	  //Check WordPress Installation files
	  $ ls
	  
	  // Verify DB Connection Details by opening the file wp-config.php. These DB connection details was defined in User Data section.
	  $ vi wp-config.php 		  
	  
	  // Verify Httpd Service is running
	  $ ps -aux | grep httpd
	  $ cd /var/log/
	  $ ls
	  
	  // Go to End of the file. Verify Last Line which has updated date and time of the installation.
	  $ vi cloud-init-output.log 
		  
	   From Public DNS, You can see Word Press Initial Website where you need to enter WordPress Title, initial credentials and email. Later this page is redirected to Login Page to enter the credentials. After successful login, click on title where you see landing page of Word Press.
	   
	   Template location - advance-templates/wp-infrastructure-install.yaml
	   
### 8. Installing and Configuring -  Web Server, PHP, WordPress using Using cfn-init and cfn-hup  
	   <p align=”justify”>This is an effective and platform independent approach i.e., usually for Linux Platform, UserData Section consists of shell scripts whereas for Windows platform, UserData section use to be batch / powershell script. Therefore, for any Platform their is necessity of creating script supported by new platforms which makes process ineffective. Hence, resulting in many scripts which will difficult to manage.
	   
	   cfn-init and cfn-hup provides a effective way of implementing generic script supported by most of the platforms.

	   SSH to EC2 Instance to verify the logs.</p>
	   
	   $ cd /var/log/
	   
	   $ ls
	   
       cloud-init.log and cloud-init-output.log are generated when UserData Section is used
       cloud-init-output.log - output data of script executed from commands defined in UserData Section 	   
	   cfn-init.log and cfn-init-cmd.log are the files generated from cfn-init process
	   cfn-init.log - will provide command output of cfn-init process which is executed from metadata section
	   cfn-hup.log - generated from cfn-hup process when it is configured and started i.e., cfn-hup helper is a daemon that detects changes in resource metadata and runs user-specified actions when a change is detected.
	   
	   If we poll the logs from cfn-hup.log, 
	   
	   $ cat cfn-hup.log
	   
	   From the template, as it is polled every 5 minutes.
	   
	   Browse, Public IP Address - http://<publicip>/index2.html -> You can see string on the browser which is defined in Parameter Section of the template - "HelloWorld"
	   
	   Whenever this sample string is changed, cfn-hup detect the changes in the file index2.html. cfn-hup polls the changes. 
	   
       $ tail -f cfn-hup.log
	   
	   Template location - advance-templates/wp-infrastructure-cfn-init.yaml       
	   
### 9. Creation Policy and cfn-signal
       cfn-signal - will help to send signal to Creation Policy about resource creation completion signal to CreationPolicy.
	   
	   Template Location -
	   a. with no cfn-signal defined - advance-templates/wp-infrastructure-creationpolicy-no-cfn-signal.yaml
	   b. with cfn-signal defined - advance-templates/wp-infrastructure-creationpolicy-cfn-signal.yaml
	   
### 10. Deletion Policy
       Supported types are Delete, Retain (Supported by few AWS Resource types) and Snapshot (Supported by few AWS Resource types).
	   By Default, Its ***Delete*** Policy. 
	   To define, explicity you implement as ***DeletionPolicy: Delete***
	   
	   a. Delete Behavior
	   Template Location: advance-templates/wp-infrastructure-delete-policy-explicit.yaml

	   b. Retain / Snapshot
		Retain Operation - Will retain s3 Bucket and skips deleting even though the stack is deleted.
		Snapshot - First creates snapshot of RDS DB Instance then initiates deleting process.
		Template Location: advance-templates/wp-infrastructure-db-snapshot_s3-retain-policy-explicit.yaml

### 11. Intrinsic Functions
    Conditonal Functions
    Restoring the DB Snapshot by demonstrating the usage of !Not, !Equals, !If Conditional Functions and AWS::NoValue Function
	
	Template Location: advance-templates/wp-infrastructure-db-snapshot-environmentselection-conditionalparam.yaml
	
	This template will create AWS Resources such as RDS Instance, EC2 Instance and S3 Instance. Also, when you create a stack you can observe, there is new parameter added as Environment Selection which includes - Development, Testing, Pre-Production, and Production. Environment selection is just dummy selection and the logic is implemented inside the Conditional Section of the template.
    
    For the DB Snapshot restore, when trying to create a stack with DB snapshot (Note: - DB snapshots can be found in the DB instances under snapshot and for which we need to copy snapshot id of DB instance). When we continue creating a stack it will Rollback due to the error - "DBName must be null when Restoring for this Engine." Because while restoring the snapshot, there are DBName, DBUser, DBPassword variables are assigned in the template which is not required for the snapshot restore. Therefore, to address this issue we can use "AWS::NoValue" which help to omit variables during snapshot restore.
	You can refer modified file in the below location.
	
	Template Location: advance-templates/wp-infrastructure-db-snapshot-environmentselection-conditionalparam-noval.yaml
	
	Other Conditional Intrinsic Functions - Fn::Select | !Select, Fn::GetAzs, Fn::GetAtt, !Join, Fn::And | !And, Fn::Or | !Or, !Not
	
	Parametric Constraints, Kindly check in Parameter section where limits of certain Parameters are defined, like MinLength, MaxLength, NoEcho, AllowedValues. If any of these parameter constraints are not met during Stack Creation, CloudFormation would throw Validation Error. Please refer comment - Parameter Constraints in the template file - 
	advance-templates/wp-infrastructure-db-snapshot-environmentselection-conditionalparam-noval.yaml

### 12. Setting up Shared Infrastructure
    In this section, Cloud Formation template will help to create VPC, Internet Gateway, Nat Gateway for accessing private subnets, 3 Subnets, Elastic IP, and Routetables
    
    VPC ID - 10.20.0.0/16
    Subnet A - 10.20.0.0/22
    Subnet B - 10.20.4.0/22
    Subnet C - 10.20.8.0/22	
    
	Template Location: advance-templates/00-basic-sharedinfrastructure.yaml
	
### 13. Setting up Application
    In this section, we will set up the application environment with required ELB, EC2 instances, Security Group and subnets without overrlapping with shared infrastructure Cidr addresses.
	
	Application Subnets Cidr will be is as follows:
	App. Public Subnet A - 10.20.13.0/24
	App. Public Subnet B - 10.20.14.0/24
	App. Public Subnet C - 10.20.15.0/24
	App. Private Subnet A - 10.20.16.0/24
	App. Private Subnet B - 10.20.17.0/24
	App. Private Subnet C - 10.20.18.0/24
    
	Application Version: 1,2,3 => Predefined for the application to work and demonstrate testing process.
	During Stack creation, If Applicaiton Version 2 is given in the input screen will not pass test due to failure in Test String Pattern and results in Failure of Stack Creation Process. This is due to CreationPolicy process. However, Suppose if Application Version 1/3 is entered during stack creation process, then stack creation will be Successful.
	
	Note - CreationPolicy will not be invoked during Stack Update process. For Example, During stack creation was successful, when we entered Application Version entered as 1 or 3. However, When we perform stack update, all subsequent updates will always be successful Even if you enter application version 2. Because during stack update process CreationPolicy will not be executed and Hence it was successful. Even though, Test Data String Comparison with Application Data String was a failure for application version 2, Still, End result of the update process was Successful. 
	
	Template Location: advance-templates/00-application-environment.yaml
	
### 14. Stack Reuse
   
   It is achieved by the concept of Cross Stack Reference. 
  
   To demonstrate cross stack reference, We will export parameters from the primary template which will be reused in Nested Stack. Later, in the nested stack we will import the value.
   
   ```yaml
   Primary Stack :
           Template Location: advance-templates/01-basic-sharedinfrastructure-crossstackref-export.yaml
		   Outputs:
			  vpcid:
				Description: Shared Infrastructure VPC ID
				Value: !Ref MyVPC
				Export:  # Cross Stack Ref. to export the values in the other stack
				  Name: basicsharedinfra-vpcid # must be unique in the region and Account. Usage here is "basicsharedinfra-" is the key followed by "vpcid"[which is outputs logical id]=> basicsharedinfra-vpcid 
    Nested Stack:
	       Template Location: advance-templates/01-application-environment-crossstackref-import.yaml
		   Resources:
			  PublicSubnetA: # Public Subnet for App Env in AZ - A
				Type: AWS::EC2::Subnet
				Properties:
				  AvailabilityZone: !Select [0, !GetAZs ]
				  CidrBlock: !Ref applicationpubliccidra
				  MapPublicIpOnLaunch: true
				  VpcId: !ImportValue basicsharedinfra-vpcid # Value is imported from 01-basic-sharedinfrastructure-crossstackref-export.yaml file. This key name is available in the Outputs section of vpcid under Export section. Similarily, whereever these common parameters from infrastructure are required we import it using !ImportValue
    ```
